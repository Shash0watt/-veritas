# -veritas
An attempt at making my very own Arch Linux distro 

The goals that I have set for myself is to create something that is 
- Reliable and stable enough for day to day use
- Looks nice and clean, probably minimal and rounded (but opinions on appearence are subjective
- Lightweight, (Hopefuly no more than 2GB)

And that's all for now,
:)
